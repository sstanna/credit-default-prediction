# FINAL PROJECT: PD MODEL PIPELINE AUTOMATION

## Project Description

Implemented end-to-end automated pipeline for development, testing, deployment and monitoring of machine learning models for predicting client default probability.

**Domain:** Finance / Credit Scoring  
**Dataset:** Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset (UCI ML Repository)  
**Data Size:** 30,000 records, 25 features

## Completed Requirements

###  1. Code Organization and Version Control (Git) 
- Created structured project structure following cookiecutter-data-science standard
- Code organized in modules: src/, tests/, notebooks/, data/, models/
- Prepared meaningful commits for Git

###  2. Data Preparation and Validation
- Data loading and preprocessing scripts implemented
- Feature Engineering: aggregated features from payment history, age binning
- Data validation with Great Expectations suite
- Tests for data validation that fail on anomalies

###  3. Model Building and Tuning 
- Data split into train/test sets
- Sklearn Pipeline with preprocessing (Imputer, Scaler, OneHotEncoder)
- Model training (LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier)
- Automatic hyperparameter tuning with RandomizedSearchCV
- Key metrics calculated: ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- ROC curve visualization

###  4. Experimentation and Logging 
- MLflow Tracking integrated into training code
- Logged parameters, metrics, artifacts (including ROC curve and trained model)
- Conducted 5+ experiments with different algorithms and hyperparameters
- MLflow UI available for experiment analysis

### âœ… 5. Data and Model Versioning 
- DVC initialized in repository
- DVC configured for dataset and model versioning
- Configuration described in dvc.yaml
- DVC pipeline implemented with prepare and train stages

### âœ… 6. Testing and CI 
- Unit tests written with pytest for key functions
- GitHub Actions configured for automatic test runs
- Code quality checks: linting with flake8 and formatting with black
- CI pipeline includes data validation step with Great Expectations

### âœ… 7. Containerization and Deployment 
- Dockerfile created for application containerization
- Simple REST API implemented with FastAPI
- API has /predict endpoint accepting JSON features and returning predictions
- Docker build and run scripts prepared
- API tested and working locally

###  8. Monitoring (Drift)
- Simple Python script for data drift monitoring
- Population Stability Index (PSI) calculation implemented
- Script compares new data with training data
- Drift metrics calculated for key features

###  9. Documentation 
- Clear README.md describing project structure and launch instructions
- Comprehensive project documentation

## Technical Implementation

### Data Processing
- **Dataset:** UCI Credit Card Default (30,000 records)
- **Target:** default.payment.next.month (22.12% default rate)
- **Features:** 25 features including demographics, payment history, bill amounts
- **Preprocessing:** Missing value imputation, scaling, encoding

### Model Training
- **Algorithms:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- **Pipeline:** Sklearn Pipeline with preprocessing steps
- **Tuning:** RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization
- **Metrics:** ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

### API Implementation
- **Framework:** FastAPI
- **Endpoints:** /predict, /health, /model_info, /predict_batch
- **Input:** JSON with 24 features
- **Output:** Prediction class and probability

### Monitoring
- **Drift Detection:** Population Stability Index (PSI)
- **Features Monitored:** Key numerical features
- **Threshold:** PSI > 0.2 indicates significant drift
